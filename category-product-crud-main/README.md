Spring Boot REST API for Category and Product Management

This Spring Boot application provides a robust RESTful API for managing categories and products. It incorporates essential features such as:

Core Functionalities:

CRUD Operations:
Categories: Create, Read, Update, and Delete categories.
Products: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
One-to-Many Relationship:
A category can have multiple products, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
Server-Side Pagination:
Efficiently handles large datasets by implementing server-side pagination.
Error Handling:
Provides informative error messages for various exceptions.
Data Validation:
Validates input data to ensure data integrity.
Technical Implementation:

Spring Boot: Leverages Spring Boot for rapid application development.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access and repository interactions with MySQL database.
RESTful API: Exposes RESTful endpoints for seamless communication with clients.
JSON Format: Uses JSON as the data format for API requests and responses.
